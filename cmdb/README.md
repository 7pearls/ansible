## Ansible CMDB ? 

##### We all know ansible gathers lot of data from the remote hosts while we run the plays, nothing but facts we call. 

##### These facts has the information about each remote host such as os, hardware, ram, cpu mounts etc. and this data is in JSON format. 

##### Can we use this data to populate a nice html or any human understandable format ? Yes we can

##### We can write a wrapper/script to pull the necessary values from facts generated by ansible & convert them into the format which we want. 
	
```
		OR
```

##### Does ansible provide any solution for this ? 

##### Yes, there is a solution from Ansible, which is ANSIBLE-CMDB

```
So, 
```

##### Ansible-cmdb takes the output of Ansible's fact gathering and converts it into a static HTML overview page (and other things) containing system configuration information.

##### It also supports multiple output formats such as html, csv, sql, etc. and extending information gathered by Ansible with custom data. For each host it also shows the groups, host variables, custom variables and machine-local facts.
