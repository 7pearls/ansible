### before we understand what is configuration management, let's first understand some basics as below 

## what is change management ? 

##### Change management is the process that helps to implement a change to Production system/server, typically it talks about 

	* why the change is required ?
	* what is the change about ?
	* when it should be implemented ?
	* who will implement it ? 
	* how much time required to implement the change ?
	* are the implementation steps documented ? 
	* how to rollback if any issues during the change implementation ? 
	* do we have all approvals (from client & management ) to implement the change ?
	* who will ensure the system/server back online after the change is implemented ? 


##### `technically:` Change management is the process, tools and techniques to manage the people side of change to achieve the required business outcome. 

##### Change management focuses on the people impacted by the change. Any change to processes, systems, organization structures and/or job roles will have a technical side and a people side.

## what is a change on server/computer/system ?

##### `in simple words:` any action that we perform on a server / system that alters the state of the server/system is called a change. 

```
such as: 
	* create/modify/delete/update a file OR a directory
	* install/deploy a new software/application
	* uninstall a software/application 
	* upgrade a software
	
	  etc....
```

## what is configuration ? 

##### `Technically:` Configuration is the manner in which components are arranged to make up the computer system. Configuration consists of both hardware and software components. Sometimes, people specifically point to hardware arrangement as hardware configuration and to software components as software configuration. 

## what is configuration change ?

##### `in simple words:` any change that we do to a system can be called as configuration change on system/server.
